wcsend Drupal module


To use this you need:
	- perl installed
	- these perl modules:
		 - HTML::FormatText::WithLinks
		 - LWP::UserAgent
		 - SOAP::Lite

 	- the two perl scripts should be executable

	- the two perl scripts contain WhatCounts login credentials, which must be up to date

	- to enable the module

	- to assign 'send email via WhatCounts (wcsend module)' permission to the Drupal role who will be
	   able to send emails out via whatcounts


In your theme, put something like this, to insert the link to send the email.  This is a link that, when clicked,
   will send the contents of the page that it is on.  It will send the version that an anonymous user would see,
   so the link itself won't be mailed out.



	<?php  // Show link to send the email via WhatCounts.
	       //
	       // For more info on this, see the README for the wcsend module.

		if (user_access('send email via WhatCounts (wcsend module)')) {


			printf (
				<<<END_PRINT
				    <tr>
				       <td align="center">
					  <div style="background-color:yellow; padding:12px;">%s</div>
				       </td>
				    </tr>

END_PRINT
				,
				l('Send this email now via whatcounts!',
					sprintf('wcsend/%s/%s',
					md5($node->path . "secret phrase that won't be guessed"), // If changing secret phrase, change it in wcsend.module too.
					$node->path )
				 )
			);

		}
	?>


In your theme, you also need to put this section.  It contains the parameters for the email send.
"changetemplate_plain_text" is there as a place-holder, in case someday you set up a special field 
to contain the plain-text version of the email.  In the meantime, we convert the HTML to plain-text
programmatically.

Only list_id is required.  If no template_id is specified, it will use (and possibly modify) the default 
template for the list.  If other parameters are not specified, they will not be modified in the list 
or in the template.

There are lots of other parameters you can add-- look in the launch_whatcounts_email.pl script for
the ones you can pass in.


	<?php
	printf (
		<<<END_PRINT
	<!--
	----start wcsend params----
	  changelist_from_name = %s  # You can put comments in with the '#' symbol.
	  changelist_from_email = %s
	  changetemplate_subject = %s
	  changetemplate_plain_text = %s
	  segmentation_id = %d
	  list_id = %d
	  template_id = %d
	  format = 99     # -1=subscriber, 1=text, 2=html, 99=Multi-part MIME
	----end wcsend params----
	-->
END_PRINT
		,
		$node->field_whatcounts_from_name[0]['view'],
		$node->field_whatcounts_from_emailaddr[0]['email'],
		$node->title,
		"This is not really used at the moment-- we are converting HTML to plain text to get this value",
		$node->field_wcsend_segmentation_rule[0]['value'],
		36467,
		129064
	);
	?>
